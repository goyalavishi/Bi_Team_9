# Fake and Real News Predictor

Do you know the news you read today morning was a fake one or true ?
Can you find the difference between them ?


The authenticity of news has become a longstanding issue affecting
businesses and society, both for printed and digital media. On social networks,
the reach and effects of news spread occur at such a fast pace and so
amplified that distorted, inaccurate or false news acquires a tremendous
potential to cause real world impacts, within minutes, for millions of users.

We here, try to solve this issue of fake news through the concepts of machine
learning by predicting if the content of information is real or fake.
